# This file will contain functions to plot different outputs of interferograms and coregistration workflows

# Map() -- This returns an empty map object which users can plot directly on there jupyter notebooks, uses folium

# ImageOverlay() -- A wrapper above folium.ImageOverlay. 
# We also wrap the add_to method which adds the calling object to the map and returns a new map.

# This way users can keep adding layers to there map.

# Note: Let's work on this once we have convert_to_cog function ready.
