# edk-sar

This repository provides a convenient wrapper around the ISCE2 (InSAR Scientific Computing Environment) framework, making it easy for users to perform InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) analysis. 

With edk-sar, you get a collection of tools and utilities that simplify the process of running InSAR workflows. By abstracting and automating many of the steps required by ISCE2, this repo enables researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to efficiently process SAR data, generate interferograms, and analyze ground deformation with minimal setup.

If you're looking to leverage the power of ISCE2 for InSAR analysis without dealing with its complexity directly, edk-sar is designed for you.
